Inheritance:
------------
Inherit the state and behovioues from one class to another class it's called inheritance.

-->By using inheritance we can avoid the code repetation.
-->we can't inherit sealed class and final class.

there are 5 types of inheritance
---------------------------------
1.Single Inheritance
2.Multiple Inheritance
3.Hierarchical Inheritance 
4.MultiLevel Inheritance
5.Hybrid Inheritance

1.Single Inheritance:
                     One child class extends one parent class

2.Multiple Inheritance:
                     one child class extends Parent class again another child class extends Already derived child class.

3.Hierarchical Inheritance:
                     Two child class extends one parent class

4.MultiLevel Inheritance:
                     One child class Extends two parent class.

  -->this type of inheritance is possible only in inheritance.
  -->this type of Inheritance is not Possible in class due to
       *Ambiguting in Constractor chaining
       *Method duplication is Possible in this type of Inheiritance

5.Hybrid Inheritance:
                   It's combination of Multiple and hierarchical Inheritance
