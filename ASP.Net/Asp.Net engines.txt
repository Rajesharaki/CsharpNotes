Out of the box Asp.net offers the following 2 view engines
1.ASPX
2.Razor

1.What is the difference between RAZOR and ASPX view engines?
Ans:
    It mostly boils down the syntax otherwise there are no major difference between the two. In ASPX view engine,the serverside script is wrapped between <% %>,where as in Razor we use @.
Razor view have the extension based on language if we use c# then .cshtml or if its VB then .vbhtml where as ASPX views has the extension of .ASPX

2.is it possible to have both RAZOR and ASPX view in one Application?
Ans:
----
    Yes, but at that we must and should mention the view Name

Convention used by MVC to find views:
--------------------------------------
*By convention MVC looks for a view with the same name as that of the controller action method name in the folloeing locations
1.Views/FolderNameMatchingControllerName
2.Views/Shared

Note:
----
the view extensiona can be any of the folloeing
1).cshtml -->Razor engine view (C#)
2).vbhtml -->Razor Enginr view (VB)
3).aspx --> aspx engine
4).ascx --> paritial view

for example in my project i have following views which one will excute
1.index.cshtml
2.index.aspx
3.index.ascx
4.index.ascx

by default it will search and excute index.aspx but if view want to excute index.cshtml or so on we
entred path inside the controller action method view()
~ its indecates current foloder

ex:
---
public ActionResult Index()
{
  view("~Views/ControllerName/Views/index.cshtml)
}
