Variables:

-static variable
-non static variable
-constant variable
-ReadOnly variable

STATIC VARIABLE:

-->static variable: if the variable explicitly declared by using static modifiers or else
if the variable declared under the static block that type of variable called static variable
-->static variable have only one copy init.we can modified the static variable
-->without creacting an instance we can access static variable.memory allocated at the time of declaration

NON-STATIC VARIABLE:

-->if the variable is not declared with any modifier that type of variable we called non static variable.
-->memory allocated at the time of instance create.and this type variable have 'n' number of copies.

CONSTANT VARIABLE:

-->if the variable explicitly declared by using Const modifier that type of variable called Constant variable.
-->it similar to the static variable but we can't modified constant variable.
-->if Constvariable we must and should assign value at the time of declaration.

READONLY VARIABLE:

-->if the variable explicitly declared by using readOnly Modifier that type of variable called ReadOnly Modifiers.
-->Memory allocated at the time instance create but the difference b/w non static and ReadOnly variable is if we declaread ReadOnly varaible once we can't modified
-->It can have 'n' number of copies.
