Delegates Example:
-------------------

  class Program
    {
        public static void Delegates(string UserName) //method code
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello "+UserName);
        }
        public delegate void DelegatesMethod(string UserName); //Declare Delgates the syntax is same as method syntax
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            DelegatesMethod Methodcall = new  DelegatesMethod(Program.Delegates); //creating delagtes object and passing method
            Methodcall("Rajesha");// by using Delegates method refence we calling method and here we pass method arguments.
        }
    }
Defenation:
------------
* Delgates is a Type safe and it holds the method refence . By using Delegtes we make reuseable method code 
* by using delgate keyword we declare delegate and the deleagate syntax same as the method syntax but in 
  delgates we use delagate keyword
