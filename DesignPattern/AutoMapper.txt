AutoMapper:
-----------
* Auto mapper is nothing but mapping one object to anthoer
                        or
* Copy or transfer  the data from one class object to another class object


Reflection:
-----------
Reflection is the ability of inspecting an assemblies metadata at runtime.it is used to find all tyoes in an assembly and or dynamically invoke 
methos in an assembly.

Uses of Reflection:
-------------------
1. When you drag and drop a button on a win forms or an asp.net application. The properties window uses reflection to show all the properties of the
Button class . So reflection is extensively used by IDE or a UI designers

2.Late binding can be achived by using reflection.You can use reflection to dyanmically create an instance of a type,about which we don't have any information
at compile time . So ,reflection enables you to use code that is not available at compile time.

3.Consider an Example where we have two alternate implementation of an interface. You want to allow the user to pick one or the other using a config file.
with reflection you can simply rerad the name of the class whose implementation you want to use from the config file, and instantiate an instance of that class.
this is another example for late binding using reflection.
