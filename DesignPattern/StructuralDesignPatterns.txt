--------------
               Handle remote method call because remote innvocation is complex.

2.Virtual Proxy:
----------------

3.Protection Proxy:
-------------------
                Check access to real subject (Or a subset of its functionality)         

*Proxies may implement additional business rules before and or after calling a method on the real subject
