Destructors:
-------------
             Destructors are methods inside the class used to destroy instance of that class when they are no longer needed 
The Destructor is called implicitly by .Net Frame work's Garbage collector and therefore programmer has no control as when to invoke 
the destructor.

Important points:
-----------------
* A Destructor is unique to its class i.e there can't be more than one destructor in a class
* A Destructor has no return type and destructor name should be same as Class name
* A Destructor doesn't accept any parameter and modifier
* It can't be declared in structure its anly used with classes
* it can't be overloaded and inherited
* It called automatically when the program exists
* internally, Destructor called Finalized method on the base class object.

  ~Example()
   {   
     // your code
   }
