Method OverLoading:
                  The methods have same name with differnt signeture is called Method over loading

Method Duplication:
                  the methods have same name with same signeture is called Method Duplication

Method Override:
                  Re-implementing the Inherieted method or change in implementation is called Method Overriding


Difference B/W Method Overloading and Overrideing


      METHOD OVER LOADING                                  METHOD OVER RIDING

*we can overload constractor                       *we Can't override constructor

*Access Modifier and return statement is not       *Access Modifier and return statement is consider
consider in method over loading

*method over loading is possible without           *method overriding is possible only through inheritance
 inheritance

*overloading method there is no keyword used       *method overriding we use override keyword

*by using method overloading we can achive compile *by using method overriding we can achive Runtime polymarphism
 time polymarphism

*Method over loading signeture should be diffent   *Method overriding method signeture is not considered

*if Method is static,private or final method       *is method is static,private or final Method overriding isn't
 overloading is possible                            possible
