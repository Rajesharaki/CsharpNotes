      struct is user defind type,

Difference B/W Class and struct

-->class is refence type where as struct is a value type   
-->Memory allocation for instance of class is performed on managed heap
   where as memory allocation for instance of structure is performed on stack
-->we use class for representing an entitiy eith large volume of data
   whereas we use strucure for representig smaller volume of data
--> Incase of class 'new' keyword is mandtory to create instance but in structure new key word is optional
-->Fields of class can be intialized at the time of declartion whereas it's not possible with fields in structure

Syntax :

[<Modifier>] struct <structName>
{
  Member(like Datafields,constructors,functions,property,events,indexer)
}
