Struct:
      struct is user defind type,

Difference B/W Class and struct

-->class is refence type where as struct is a value type   
-->Memory allocation for instance of class is performed on managed heap
   where as memory allocation for instance of structure is performed on stack
-->we use class for representing an entitiy with large volume of data
   whereas we use strucure for representig smaller volume of data
-->Incase of class 'new' keyword is mandtory to create instance but in structure new key word is optional
-->Fields of class can be intialized at the time of declartion whereas it's not possible with fields in structure

Syntax :

[<Modifier>] struct <structName>
{
  Member(like Datafields,constructors,functions,property,events,indexer)
}

Imporatant Points:
--------------------
* Struct is a class but is light weight and faster
* within a struct declaration fields are can't be intialized unless they are const or static 
* struct may not declare a default constructor(a constructor without parameter)
  or a destructor 
*Struct are value types and classes are reference type(Value type are faster than the refrence type)
*Struct contains only parameterized constructor and Nodestructors
*Struct are by default sealed
*Most of Primitive types in .Net are struct
